# pebble-abfahrten

This is a copy of the repo infanf/pebble-abfahrten.  infanf provides a great Pebble App which shows you the departure times of nearby bus and train stations in Munich (or precisely in the area of the MVV).  This is a modified Pebble app which has mostly the same functionality, but furthermore, in my app stations can be saved as favorites.  Therefore you do not always need a GPS signal for checking the departures at your most frequent stations.

My app has a differnt name, so that I can distinguish between my version and the version of infanf when both are installed on my watch.

To test this app, just download the .pbw-file to you phone and open it with the Pebble app.  Alternatively you can import this Git project in cloudpebble.net to create your own executables.

Currently this app features the original Pebble, Pebble Steel, Pebble Time (Steel) and Pebble Round.  For platform reasons, Pebble 2 (Time) is not supported -- sorry!
