# pebble-abfahrten

This is a modification of the Pebble-App which is provided by infanf in his repository pebble-abfahrten.  It shows you the departure times of nearby bus and train stations in Munich (or precisely in the area of the MVV).  My version can additionally save stations as favorites.  Therefore you do not always need a GPS signal for checking the departures at your most frequent stations.

Infanf updated the Pebble-App which he provides in the appstore, so you can now install my version easily on your smartwach (at least, this was correct on 10 July 2017).  Alternatively you can download the .pbw-file to you phone and open it with the Pebble app or you can import this Git project in cloudpebble.net to create your own executables.

Currently this app features the original Pebble, Pebble Steel, Pebble Time (Steel) and Pebble Round.  For platform reasons, Pebble 2 (Time) is not supported -- sorry!
